Elevator Algorithm
- When you arrive at the elevator, press the "up" or "down" button/arrow to summon the elevator, whether you want to go up or down respectively.
- Wait for a sound or light to indicate that the elevator going your desired direction is present.
- When the elevator arrives, enter through the open elevator doors.
- Once inside, find the panel of numbers and letters from which you can select your destination floor.
- Start at the lowest-left button.
- Until you find a button that matches your desired destination:
    + Check to see if the button matches your desired destination
    + If it does not:
        * move to the button immediately right of that button. If there is not a button to the right, move to the button one row above all the way to the left.
    + If it does:
        * press it.
    + If you have cycled through all of the buttons and you have not found a match:
        * ask a human to clarify which button to press.
- Move away from the panel of buttons toward the back of the elevator if possible.
- Remain on the elevator until it reaches your desired floor.
- Exit the elevator when the doors open on your floor, only after allowing the ladies to leave first. You are a chivalrous robot, after all.


Common Algorithm: Fill Dishwasher
- When you finish using a dish, bring it into the kitchen.
- Very briefly rinse the dish with water to clear any large waste.
- Place your dish next to the sink with any other dishes that have been left there.
- Open the dishwasher door.
- If the dishwasher is clean
    + empty the dishes into their appropriate cupboards.
- For each dish remaining next to the sink:
    + If the dishwasher is full and dirty:
        * place detergent in the appropriate container, close door and start dishwasher cycle.
    + Otherwise:
        * Place dish into the dishwasher.
