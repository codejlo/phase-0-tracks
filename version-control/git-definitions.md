# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a procedure that allows (one or) many programmers to make edits to the same code repository while avoiding conflicts. It is useful so that many programmers can work with many different instances of the same code and collate changes automatically while avoiding conflicts.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a temporary copy of one or more folders/files in a repository that allows the user to make edits to the branched code, markdown files and related documents without changing the master branch or other branches. Branches can be merged back into each other or into a master to incorporate changes made on one or more branches into the main code base (usually after being checked by other team members for errors).

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a command to git to incorporate the changes made in a file to the repository after it has been added to a commit queue.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when you attempt to merge a branch with another and the same code or file has been modified in both branches. In this case, git cannot automatically merge branches without user intervention to understand the area of conflict and make adjustments required for the changes to work together.
